# Depth Estimation with Object Detection

## Overview
This project implements a depth estimation system that detects objects in images and estimates their distances using pre-trained models (DETR for object detection and GLPN for depth estimation).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Final Notes
- Ensure all paths in the `config.py` file are correctly set according to your file structure.
- Include appropriate pre-trained models in the `data/models/` directory to run the project successfully.
- Test the entire flow to make sure all components are working together as expected. 

Feel free to customize any part of the project structure or code as needed!
